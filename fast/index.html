		<section id="abstract">Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies (FAST) advises creators of technical specifications how to ensure their technology meets the needs of user with disabilities. It addresses primarily web content technologies but also relates to any technology that affects web content sent to users, including client-side APIs, transmission protocols, and interchange formats. Specifications that implement these guidelines make it possible for content authors and user agents to render the content in an accessible manner to people with a wide range of abilities.<p> </p></section>
		<section id="sotd">
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>Numerous guidelines exist for creating and supporting content that is accessible to people with disabilities, on and off the Web. When these guidelines are supported in the entire web ecosystem, content creators can author accessible content, and expect the accessibility features to be made available by user agents, including assistive technologies when needed. Authoring tools support creation of accessible content, and accessibility features survive transmission to different systems or conversion of content to different formats.</p>
                <p>Nearly all of these accessibility features depend on support in some form from the technology in which content is encoded, transmitted, and sometimes transformed. But there is not yet a set of well-documented guidance for such technologies. Instead, requirements are inferred from authoring and user agent guidelines. This makes it complicated for technology creators to ensure they have met the full set of needs. Review from accessibility specialists is limited by bandwidth and expertise, so does not fully address that problem. As a result, varying technologies provide various levels of support with varying levels of compatibility with other technologies. These issues at the core layers of Web technology impact the progress that can be made from support of higher-level guidelines.</p>
                <p>Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies aims to fill this gap. It is intended to be a single, well-considered set of guidelines addressing specifically the features technologies need to provide to support accessible. These guidelines relate to the requirements of other guidelines but should not be confused with them. The goal of FAST is to provide a single source of guidelines for Web technology accessibility. They relate to other guidelines and documentation to provide additional information and rationale for the requirement, but are intended to be a self-sufficient set of guidelines that technology creators can follow.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Audience</h3>
                <p>The primary audience of FAST is creators of Web technologies. Most of the guidelines relate to content and presentation technologies like HTML, CSS, SVG, PDF, audio/video formats, etc. Some guidelines also address data formats, interchange formats, transmission protocols, etc., usually aimed at ensuring these technologies preserve the accessibility features of content impacted by these technologies. Because of this broad set of relevant technologies, all Web technology creators are considered part of the audience for FAST.</p>
                <p>Secondary audience include creators of higher level accessibility guidelines and other advocates for web accessibility features. Because FAST has a strong grounding in user needs, researchers and advocates who identify the accessibility requirements of web users with disabilities are also an important audience.</p>
			</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Scope</h4>
					<p>Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies is a product of the World Wide Web Consortium and as such targets only the accessibility requirements of web technologies. Many of the user needs are the same for web use and non-web use, so FAST will necessarily overlap and hopefully be compatible with similar guidelines addressing non-web space. Nonetheless, FAST is not designed to be used for non-web technologies and there could be key differences. Furthermore, there are user needs that exist outside the web that do not impact the web, and those needs are completely unaddressed by FAST.</p>
                    <p>In spite of these caveats about the scope of FAST, this scope will evolve as the Web does. More and more technologies are becoming part of the Web, and bringing user needs to the Web along with them. For instance, strictly hardware accessibility issues may be non-web requirements, but the Web of Things brings many of these issues closer to the Web than in the past. FAST will need to reflect this evolution, and future versions may be required to address user needs that are new to the Web.</p>

			<section>
				<h3>Approach</h3>
                <p>The goal of FAST is to help ensure that web technologies meet the needs of users with disabilities. To do this, the work involves three stages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inventory user needs;</li>
                    <li>Identify ways to meet needs;</li>
                    <li>Develop technology guidelines.</li>
                </ul>
                <section>
                    <h4>Inventory user needs</h4>
                    <p>The first step in the development of these guidelines is to inventory known user needs. Many user needs affecting web content accessibility are well known and documented in multiple places. These needs are collected and related to each other in order to arrive at a single set of known needs. Sources examined in the development of these guidelines include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://www.jtc1access.org/documents/swga_339_DTR_29138-1_User_Needs_Summary.zip">JTC 1 User Needs</a>;
                        </li>
                    	<li><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/70913.html">ISO/IEC 30071-1 Information technology — Development of user interface accessibility — Part 1: A code of practice for creating accessible ICT products and services</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0</a>;</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/">UAAG 2.0</a>;</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/">ATAG 2.0</a>;</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/mobile-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">Mobile gap analysis</a>;</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">Cognitive gap analyses</a>;</li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-accessibility-reqs/">Media Accessibility User Requirements</a>;</li>
                        <li> Sources from other advocacy organizations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="note">Note the goal of this exercise is not to supplant other good work in this field. The aim is to assemble disparate sources if knowledge about user needs in one place, to facilitate analysis. This work is likely to spin off from the core work of developing FAST. If another organization creates a sufficiently rich collection of documented user needs it will be possible to use that resource rather than reinvent the work in W3C.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Identify ways to meet needs</h4>
                    <p>The second stage in development of the guidelines is to identify ways these needs can be met. There are three high-level ways user needs can be met:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>technology features;</li>
                        <li>author implementation;</li>
                        <li>user agent support.</li>
                    </ul>
				<p>These are not mutually exclusive categories. A given user need could be met by more than one of these categories, but the ability of a given category to meet a user need implies the need for guidelines targeting that category. In policy setting and evaluation there may be a preference hierarchy for how best to meet needs, e.g., user agent support of standard features is preferred, but author technical override is needed if user agent support is lacking. </p>
                    <p>Some needs can be met with present technology only via one of these routes. Other needs can be met by more than one route, and for content to be accessible it is only required that one of the available routes be implemented. Many needs, however, require more than one route to be implemented together for the need to be met. The most common example is that a technology provides a feature, the author uses that feature in the content, and the user agent makes the result available to the user.</p>
                    <p>All of these ways of meeting user needs are identfied, along with their relationships to each other. Once these approaches are identified, the result is separate lists of requirements for content technologies, authors, and user agents. The relationship among the routes may play a role in prioritization of guidelines, since needs that can only be met by one route may be more important to meet by that route, than needs that could be met by other means as well.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h4>Develop technology guidelines</h4>
				    <p>From the above analyses, it should also be easy to see where content technology features are required to make it possible to meet user needs. For example: </p><ul>
						<li> If the author must implement something, the technology must provide a feature for the author to implement. </li>
						<li> If the user need is met by design, the technology must provide suitably rich design capabilities. </li>
						<li> If the user need is met by user agents, the technology must provide a sufficiently rich definition of the object for user agents to implement. </li>
					</ul>
                    <p>Not all technologies will address all ways of meeting user needs. For instance, CSS is primarily design-oriented, and HTML is somewhat semantics-oriented. The technology requirements may need conformance profiles or some other way of guiding technology developers seeking to follow them. It may not be easy to state in a general prescriptive way whether a given technology should, for instance, provide a richer design capability to meet a user need or should instead rely on better semantics for assistive technology-oriented content alternatives. A good structure of the technology requirements should help make it clear that <i>some</i> method of meeting a given user need is important. Horizontal review may continue to be important in guiding technology developers through the possibilities. </p>
                    <p>The set of approaches to meeting user needs that affects technology features becomes the base information for the Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies. (The other two routes, while important to the analysis, are not directly relevant to FAST but may inform other work.) These approaches are prioritized, organized, and translated into guidelines-type language to become the Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies.</p>
                    <p>With the above analyses done, it should be easy to see how current guidelines address which user needs. In turn it should be easy to see where current guidelines to not meet user needs, that in theory should be able to be met by activities within the remit of that set of guidelines. This should be important input into WAI 3.0 / WAI 2020 planning.</p>

				<h3>Explanation of User Needs</h3>

					<figcaption>Accessibility needs become mainstream needs over time</figcaption>
				</figure>
				-->
				<p>Identify user needs that we plan to provide guidance on meeting. These should describe the needs of humans as they currently exist (i.e., without significant evolution or cyborgization from early 21st century norms), and therefore is as era-independent as possible with current knowledge. The focus is on the needs of people with disabilities, but because that is sometimes a relative / contextual condition, a significant proportion of mainstream needs will also be identified. </p>
				<p>At least two levels of needs may be identified. The first is truly generic needs, requirements users have to access and use content such as perceive and understand it, and should be stable over time. The second layer is needs specific to technologies of the day, such as ability to understand and operate controls. This layer may be understood as an implementation of the generic needs, so may not be classed as user needs in the end. Regardless of its classification, it will be an important component of understanding the space. This level of needs evolves as technology and design patterns do, so needs to be maintainable separately from the generic needs. </p>
                <section>
                    <h4>Evolution of user needs</h4>
                    <p>Where user needs are suspected but known, related work may expand the inventory through research when feasible. Therefore the set of documented user needs will evolve over time. A given set of guidelines including FAST, however, can only address needs that were known at the time of development of the guidelines.</p>

                <h3>Meeting User Needs Table</h3>
                <p class="note">This version of the resource is primarily to show the structure, not yet a comprehensive documentation of how user needs can be met. </p>
                <p>The table below shows how two of the user needs identified above might be met by technology features, author implementation, and user agent support. Each row of the table shows a related set of approaches, in which the approach in column depends on successful implementation of the approaches in the other columns for that row. For instance, many author features depend on support from the technology as well as exposure from the user agents. Some approaches to meeting user needs do not require support from others, which is reflected by rows with blank columns. For instance, it is possible for a user agent to meet certain needs with no particular support provided by the technology or author. This layout is preliminary and a more expressive layout is sought.</p>

			<h2>Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies</h2>
			<p class="note">The content below is merely initial draft content intended to show how guidelines aimed at web technology developers might look. It has not yet been related to the user needs and ways of meeting them outlined above. It serves as initial brainstorming to help demonstrate viability of this set of guidelines.</p>
			<section>

						<li> Provide a way to define non-text alternatives for non-text content . </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Color</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> Allow users to override colors of text and user interface components. </li>
					<li> Provide a feature for authors to define semantically available "color classes" that users can easily map to custom colors, and give preference to this vs. coloring objects individually. </li>

					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Compatibility with AAPIs</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> For every user interface object type, define the "type" of object as a role to AAPIs. </li>
						<li> For every user interface object type, define how authors provide or user agent determines the "accessible name" for AAPIs. </li>
						<li> For user interface objects that can have states, properties, or values, define how authors can set these and how these are exposed to AAPIs. </li>
						<li> When providing imperative mechanisms to implement technology features (e.g., scripts), provide a way for authors to expose accessibility information to AAPIs. </li>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Hardware Interfaces</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> Abstract hardware interfaces so various device types can simulate each others' functions. </li>

					</ul>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>User Customization</h2>

					<li> Define adaptive layout mechanisms that optimize for different display conditions (screen size, font size, lighting, noise, etc.) well. </li>
					<li> Separate layout semantics from content so users or tools can easily create alternate layouts. </li>
					<li> Provide ways for users to easily select font preferences (size, weight, family, specific typeface, etc.). </li>
					<li> Provide mechanisms for users to easily apply custom display requirements that preserve presentation of meaning without knowledge the idiosyncratic implementation of content. </li>

				<section>
					<h3>Blinking / Flashing</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> Define a mechanism to warn users of flashing content. </li>
						<li> Define a mechanism to identify potentially flashing content to user agents so they can suppress it on user preference. </li>

					<h3>Automatic actions</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> Provide a way for users to prevent time-based content from playing automatically, e.g., as a user agent preference that implementations must provide. </li>
						<li> Provide a way for users to request no interruptions. Note, bona fide emergency interruptions should still be allowed. </li>
						<li> Define that there will be not automatic action leading to a change of context when focus lands on a given element. </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Time-based content</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> Provide a way for users to pause and stop time-based content. </li>
						<li> Provide a way for users to start or restart time-based content. </li>
					</ul>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Focus</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> Any object that can respond to user interaction must be capable of receiving keyboard focus and actuating from keyboard input. </li>
					<li> Common objects defined by the technology should be specified to be focusable by default. </li>
					<li> Provide a means for authors to make objects focusable explicitly. </li>
					<li> Define a complete focus movement model including cycling past the end, recovering from unexpectedly lost focus, etc. so they keyboard focus is always somewhere meaningful and findable. </li>
					<li> Provide sensory and programmatic indication of focus location at all times. </li>

			<section>
				<h2>Audiovisual Content</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> Provide a mechanism to associate synchronized text tracks with audio or visual tracks (to support captions, subtitles). </li>
					<li> Provide support for at least two audio tracks so volume of foreground and background audio can be set separately. </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Extensibility</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> When providing extension mechanisms, ensure the tools exist to allow developers to provide the same level of accessibility in extensions that are possible in the root technology. This may involve exposing API methods or other properties that would otherwise not be needed. </li>
					<li> Allow extensions to intersect so accessibility features in one extension can automatically work in others. </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Alternate view modalities</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> Provide ways for linear (1-dimensional) presentations of content to presented in a different subjective order than graphical (2-dimensional) presentations. </li>

					<li> @@support for haptic and other modalities? </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Timing</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> Do not create time limitations on user interaction (e.g., actuate a default behavior if the user does not respond within a set window) unless such limitations are intrinsic to the functionality. </li>
					<li> When creating time limitations on user interaction, provide mechanisms for users to be informed in advance of those limitations. </li>
					<li> When creating time limitations on user interaction, provide a way for users to request additional time. </li>
					<li> Provide an interface between content and servers so users can be informed of and request changes to time limitations of the server. </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>User input</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> Provide ways to indicate if user input controls must have input ("required") or not accepting input ("disabled"). </li>
					<li> Provide a way to associate information about input validation errors with the specific control(s) with input problems. </li>
					<li> Provide a way for authors to provide context-sensitive help to users, and for users to access this via standard user agent features. </li>
				</ul>
