    <h3><a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/accessibility-screener/">TAG Accessibility Screener</a></h3>
    <p>Example question (4 of 7):</p>
    <fieldset>
      <legend>
        Does the spec define a protocol that conveys any data meant to be presented to a human?
      </legend>
      <div id="q4Description">
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a transport mechanism for media, such as images, video, or
            user strings, which may benefit from including an alternative
            representation as part of the payload
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Why?</strong> Any given media type in isolation (for
          example, speech) may be inaccessible or inappropriate for a
          certain subset of users, so authors should be able to provide
          alternative forms.

    <h3><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/compute-pressure/#accessibility-considerations">Compute Pressure API
        Accessibility Considerations</a></h3>
    <section id="cp-ac">
      <p>
        The Compute Pressure API is focused on improving the user experience. There are two ways in which applications
        that build on the API can positively impact accessibility.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Considering users' access needs when making decisions based on information gathered using the API.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designing and making user interfaces based on information gained from the API with accessibility in mind.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        As a consumer of the API, it's important to consider both of these opportunities. Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Decision:</strong> In a video conferencing scenario, there may be multiple video streams. The system
          may determines that it needs to drop certain streams in order to conserve resources. If one of the video
          streams comes from a sign language interpreter, then that stream must be prioritized over others, so that
          the user can still understand the conversation. In practice, this could be simply implemented by allowing
          the user to "pin" a certain stream, and ensuring that that pinned stream is never automatically dropped by
          the system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Interface:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A simple load-level meter, in which the current usage level bucket is indicated on the screen. This
              information must be conveyed using more than just color, so that people who cannot perceive color can
              still perceive the information. A symbol could be used in conjunction with color. Text could also be
              used in conjunction with both shape and color.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some applications may present a notification to the user when some functionality is restricted due to
              compute pressure. These notifications may take the form of "toast" messages, in which case care must be
              taken to ensure that people using assistive technologies (including screen readers) can be made aware of
              the notification, and dismiss it, without unduly interrupting their workflow.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <li class=next>More concrete framing and examples would be of help.</li>
      <li class=next>Further, projects like the excellent <a href="">Digital Accessibility Framework</a> have been
