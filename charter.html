        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p>Ensuring that web technology is accessible to users with disabilities requires a dedicated group to identify issues and help develop solutions. The APA Working Group complements the other WAI Working Groups by providing accessibility horizontal review of W3C publications. It also explores emerging accessibility issues and publishes its findings to help guide the community. Where accessibility gaps are found that are not addressed by current technologies, the group also incubates technical solutions.</p>
      </div>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Support W3C Working Groups, and external organizations collaborating on web technologies as time allows, to create technical specifications that provide features needed for accessibility to people with disabilities via review of documents as part of the horizontal review process, participation in architecture decisions, and by direct interaction with Working Groups as needed.</li>
					<li>Develop and publish information about accessibility of web technology, including guidance
            for technology developers, accessibility user requirements for technologies, and
            information about accessibility principles in general. </li>
          <li>Research accessibility risks and solutions for emerging web-enabled devices and web technologies, such as (but not limited to) artificial intelligence, authentication, automotive interfaces, digital publications, graphics and media, mobile communications devices, payments, tablets, virtual and augmented and mixed reality, Web-enabled television, Web of Things, etc.;</li>
          <li>Develop technological accessibility solutions as stand-alone technologies or as
            components of other web technologies that could become W3C Recommendations, including
            but not limited to WAI-Adapt features and automated pronunciation guidance.</li>

	<section id="success-criteria">
	  <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
	  <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts. To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications in Candidate Recommendation or to features that have deployed implementations should have <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.</p>
        <p>Each specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users. Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
        <p>This Working Group expects to follow the TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>. </p>
        <p>Additional success criteria:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Advancement of WAI-Adapt support on the web via specifications published by this group and features incorporated into other work.</li>
					<li>Improved accessibility of web technologies as measured by the activity of accessibility proponents in coordination with APA, accepted comments on specifications, and other tracked Working Group dialog;</li>
					<li>Release of Framework for Accessible Specifications as Working Group Note and indications of its use by other Working Groups;</li>
					<li>Documentation of new accessibility issues and solutions, potentially with spin-off work begun;</li>
					<li>Record of active and sustained coordination between APA and other stakeholders.</li>
				</ul>
	</section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes
					occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p> To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants. </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public"> Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however, except by explicit one-time invitation from the chair(s). </p>
        <p> Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group home page.</a>
				</p>
        <p> This group primarily conducts its technical work <a href="mailto:public-apa@w3.org" id="public-name">public-apa@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-apa/">archive</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/apa/" id="public-github">GitHub</a>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/communication">Additional communication channels</a> are also used. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work. </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p> This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required. </p>
        <p> However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections. </p>
        <p> To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from 2 to 7 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group. </p>
        <p> All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director. </p>
        <p>The Working Group maintains specific procedures to establish and measure consensus and address objections in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/decision-policy">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group Decision Policy</a>. All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director. </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
